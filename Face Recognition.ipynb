    "Pre-trained models have already been trained on large datasets and can perform well on a variety of tasks, including face verification. By using a pre-trained model, you can leverage the knowledge learned by the model in the training phase and fine-tune it on your specific dataset, instead of starting from scratch. This can lead to better performance and faster convergence during training. Additionally, pre-trained models are often made publicly available, making them accessible to researchers and developers who may not have the resources to train their own large models."
